**Title:** *Isotopic algebras with nonisomorphic congruence lattices*  
**Author:** William DeMeo [@williamdemeo](https://github.com/williamdemeo)

**Keywords:** isotopy; isotopic algebras; congruence lattice  

**Abstract:** We present pairs of isotopic algebras with congruence lattices of different
orders, thus answering negatively the question of whether isotopic algebras
must have isomorphic congruence lattices.  

The paper has been accepted and is in the final editorial stages. It should
appear in print sometime in 2014.  The latest revision is in the tex directory.
